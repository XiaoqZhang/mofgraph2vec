1. 
    a. Input the embedding into the neural network for different tasks
    b. Get the task specific embedding
    c. Calculate the vector similarity of the task embedding 
    d. Calculate the correlation between the vector similarity and the task value

2. hierarchical embedding of MOFs: from electronic level to atomic level to structure level
    Will the atomic level embedding help in the electronic properties?
